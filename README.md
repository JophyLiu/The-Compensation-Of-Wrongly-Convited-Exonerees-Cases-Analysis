# The-Compensation-Of-Wrongly-Convited-Exonerees-Cases-Analysis
Researchers in the United States have identied over 2,000 individuals who were wrongly convicted of crimes
that they did not commit since 1989. For the wrongfully convicted exonerees, there are two basic ways to look for
the compensation. One is state claim compensation which requires state have such state statues and the exonerees
had served in prison. And the other way is civil right claim. It require exonerees to show that the state, country,
municipality or ocer engaged in a form of misconduct and the amount of compensation have not limitation.
The dataset contians 1900 individual case with 35 variables. This paper is going to explore the relationship
between dierent factors and the likelihood of ling and prevailing state claim or civil right compensation and to nd
the in
uences of factors on the civil right compensation amount per years lost. The paper contains three part of
analysis: data preprocessing, simple inquiries and complex inquiries.
In the data preprocessing part, this paper will rst clean and correct the dataset and then add some auxiliary
variables to make the analysis more convenient. According to the pre-requirement of state claim method and civil
right method, the dataset is separated into 5 sub-datasets with 1509 exonerees being able to le the state claim
compensation, 1900 exonerees being able to le civil right compensation, 703 exonerees being able to receive state
claim compensation, 802 exonerees receiving civil right compensation and 403 exonerees prevailing the money of civil
right compensation.
In the simple inquires part, it can be found that there were 1717 incarcerate exonerees in the 1900 total exonerees.
Most of exonerees were male and black or Caucasian. Male exonerees were more likely to seek or receive compensation.
Black exonerees had higher probability to seek and receive compensation rather than Caucasian and Hispanic. Most of
exonerees would not use CIU when they sought compensation but this factor would help exonerees gain the state claim
compensation more easily. Most of exonerees who did not plead guilty would more likely to seek compensation. In the
contrast, exonerees with guilty plea were more likely to receive the compensation. Exonerees tended to ask innocence
organization (IO) to help them win the compensation. It worked when they sought state claim compensation but
unfortunately it would not help them win the civil right award. And if they were wrongly convicted by the DNA
analysis, the possibility of seeking and receiving compensation would be high. However Death penalty has little
in
uence on seeking and receiving compensation. When it comes to crime factor, the more serious the crime exonerees
had, the higher the probability they would seek compensation. But this factor would only help them win the state
claim compensation not the civil right compensation. As for the average civil right compensation amount exonerees
received per year lost, the value of amount were even and just a few variables would in
uence the amount.
In the complex inquires part, there are a lot of factors which will in
uence the likelihood of ling and prevailing
state claim or civil right claim. According to above analysis, it can be conclude that Race, Sex, State, State, Guilty
Plea, IO, Crime, Year Exonerate DNA, FC, MWID will in
uence the likelihood of ling state claim. The variable
Race, Sex, State, color State, CIU, Guilty Plea, IO, Crime, DNA, FC, P FA, OM will in
uence the likelihood of
ling civil right claim. The variables Crime, Year Exonerated, DNA, MWID, and ILD will in
uence the likelihood of
prevailing state claim. And the Variables State, color State, Guilty Plea, Year Exonerated, DNA, FC, P FA, ILD will
in
uence the likelihood of prevailing civil right.
